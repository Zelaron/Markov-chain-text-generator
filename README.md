# Markov chain text generator

This repository contains a simple yet powerful tool for generating text using a Markov chain algorithm. The tool is implemented in a single HTML file (`markov.html`) which uses JavaScript to create random, procedurally generated text based on an input text provided by the user.

## How It Works
The Markov Chain Text Generator works by taking an input string of text and breaking it down into individual words and punctuation marks. It then uses these to build a Markov chain, a type of statistical model, which it uses to generate new text that mimics the style of the input.

## Features
- Easy to use and modify
- Generates text using a basic Markov chain algorithm
- Provides a simple and intuitive user interface

## Setup
To use the Markov Chain Text Generator, simply clone or download this repository and open the `markov.html` file in any modern web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zelaron/Markov-text-generator.git
cd markov-text-generator
open markov.html
